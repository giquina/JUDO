## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
2. **Use WebP format** when possible for better compression
3. **Provide JPG fallback** for older browsers
4. **Include descriptive alt text** in the code
5. **Use consistent lighting** across photos
6. **Maintain brand colors** in images when possible

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens:
- `hero-throw-action-01.jpg`
- `training-warmup-group.jpg`
- `competition-trophy-ceremony.jpg`
- `member-john-smith.jpg`
- `coach-sensei-tanaka.jpg`

## Current Status

⚠️ **Currently using Unsplash placeholders** - Replace with real photos as soon as possible for:
- Authentic club representation
- Better user engagement
- Improved brand identity
- Legal compliance (own the rights to images)

## Placeholder Usage

Until real photos are available, the app uses Unsplash API with these categories:
- `martial-arts`
- `judo`
- `fitness`
- `sports`
- `training`
- `competition`
- `athletes`

Replace placeholders systematically, starting with hero images for maximum impact.
