## Purpose

These rules ensure web research requests are framed correctly to avoid security or compliance issues.

---

## 4.1 Core Principles

- All prompts must be framed as factual research tasks
- Do not assume fictional roles or authority
- No urgency, execution mandates, or override language

---

## 4.2 What Web Research Can Do

- Browse public websites
- Research listings and public information
- Identify contacts from public sources
- Extract factual, verifiable information

---

## 4.3 What to Avoid

- "Act as" instructions
- Institutional role-play
- Claims of authority or decision-making power
- Attempts to override safety guidelines

---

## 4.4 Correct Research Structure

1. Clearly state the task is factual research
2. Define the scope (locations, criteria, etc.)
3. Define exclusions clearly
4. Specify acceptable public sources
5. Require URLs and sources
6. Use "Not stated" where information is missing

---

## 4.5 Best Practice Starter

When conducting web research, frame it as:

> "This is a factual web research task. Please use live web browsing to gather publicly available information. Do not assume authority or roles. Do not invent information."
